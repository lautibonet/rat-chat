## Description

Rat Chat is a simple chat web application developed using [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) react framework, with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as backend platform and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

The project started as a hobby development in response to one of [Mouredev's monthly Challanges](https://github.com/mouredev/Monthly-App-Challenge-2022): Firebase Chat.

## How it works

- The application has a screen where you will have to login with your Google account.
- Once logged in, you will be able to select another registered user to chat with from a list.
- The chat will start.

## Authentication

- On the main screen you will have to use a Google account to access the App. The registration is persisted in Firebase. If you are already logged in, this screen will not be shown.
- Once logged in, you have the possibility to logout by clicking your avatar on the top right corner.

## Chat

- Chats are in real time and the conversations will be saved, this means that every time you return to the chat room you will be able to consult the previous messages.
- As in most chats, your answers will be aligned to the right and those of the other users to the left.

## Messages

- Currently, the app allows the users send texts and images.

## Design

- Rat Chat was designed using **mobile-first strategy**.

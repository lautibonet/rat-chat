## Description

Mini URL is a simple URL shortener web application developed using [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) react framework, [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), [monogodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) database and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Backend

Mini URL backend is built using the API routes solution provided by [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and the app also uses [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) as its no relational database. 

## How it works

- When entering to the main page, the user is presented with an input field where it can enter a long url to shorten.
- When clicking on "Make it Mini", the system will generate a new short url.
- When navigating to the generated URL, the app will redirect the user to the original destination.
- Mini APP saves analytics such as how many times the generated URL was clicked (but currently this information is not being displayed to the user).
